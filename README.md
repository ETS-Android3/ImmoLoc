### Details of our app

The greatest part of the functionalities inherent to real estate rentals are accessible by creating an account. Otherwise, you will just be able to see ads published by users already registered. <br>
Two type of registration are provided : Particulier and Profesionnel. Theoretically, you could access to more functionalities by registering profesionnally. It's a prospect for improvement of our application. For now, it has not any effect on your continuation in the app.

Once your account is created, you can access the functionalities developped : you can publish your own ad, manage your profile, contact users if an ad interest you, modify your own ad(s), search for a specific real estate through a set of filters, and so on.


### Prospects for improvement
As stated before, we could distinguish the two types of registration: individual or profesional. We could provide a machine learning tool for ads recommandations. To strenghten the posting of an ad and visualize some statistics for profesional registered users about ads they have published.
Also put an ad in favorite, get an alert when an ad that potentially could interest us or when a property has been rented, for example.
